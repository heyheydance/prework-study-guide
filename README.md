# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide for getting into the world of web design. This project was created as a go to source to get quick information about some of the main commands and functions that you will constantly use in web development. It is a way to easily see commands that you will be using for almost every project you work on in the future. I created it so that people can easily find vital information that will create ease of life for them during the development cycle. This project is designed to solve the problem of having to search for specific notes. There are times when you forget even the most basic of commands, so you can come here and easily find them for use in your project development. Through this project I learned how to create a webpage, add style to it, and incorporate interactive functions. Hopefully this project can help you as well as you learn the ins and outs of web development.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
